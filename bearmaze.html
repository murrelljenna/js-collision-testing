Project Purpose:

	- Strengthen ability to efficiently organize code for better readability and reusability.
		- Seperate variable declarations from blocks of code that use those variables, especially loops.
	- Create an effective collision detection system (in terms of less complicated code and less machine-intensive code.
	- More effectively use Math.random() method.
	- Improve procedural canvas generation. I.E. find less gimmicky methods to create entrypoints and collision gaps.
